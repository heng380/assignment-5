      "response: We know that Natalia sold clips in April and May, and we are asked to find out how many clips she sold altogether. First, let's look at the information given. In April, she sold clips to 48 friends, and she sold half as many clips in May. Let's call the number of clips she sold in April C. Therefore, the number of clips she sold in May is one half the number of clips she sold in April, which we can denote as C/2. We are asked to find out C + C/2, which is the same as 3/2C. According to the problem, 3/2C = 48. Let's now solve 3/2C = 48 for C. Multiply both sides of the equation by 2, so you get 3C = 96. Finally, divide both sides of the new equation by 3, and you get C = 32. This means that Natalia sold clips to 32 friends in April, and half that number, which is 16, in May. Now, we can do 32 + 16 to see how many clips Natalia sold altogether. 32 + 16 = 48</answer>\n",
